Problem Statement 1 : Spell the Number
Please write code which takes a whole number and spells it out in words. For instance if 13456 is input it should be spelled as “thirteen thousand four
hundred and fifty six”. The developer could choose to spell it out using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_numbering_system or international numbering
system https://www.math-only-math.com/international-numbering-system.html
